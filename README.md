Xmas Gifts
David Figge

-- Origins -- 

I wrote this code in 2017. Among other things, this was an opportunity to learn about Swift.
It also provided me with an app that I could use. Although I have updated the code to adapt to changes in the OS over the years, it has not been updated to include newer more efficient iOS APIs (other than APIs that were deprecated or removed and stopped the app from working properly).

Basically, the app keeps track of who you are buying Christmas presents for. For each person
there is a list of items on their Christmas list. When you purchase an item, you can indicate that.
This allows you one place where you know what you've purchased and can compare it against
your individual budget for gifts for the person, or your overall Christmas budget. This app uses
Touch/Face ID as a security element (to make sure others don't see what you've purchased). It also
uses Google's FireBase to store the data into a shared repository. This allows you to access and
update the shared list from any of your devices

So you shouldn't take this code to be a recent example of code that I write, but it can be used to
as an example of the STYLE of code that I write. This is code for my own use, and was not
intended for public consumption. The source code you see is the way I like to write my source code.
My intent was to write the code in clear and flexible ways so that it was easy to understand what
the code is doing years later as I needed to maintain and/or add to it.

I have not submitted this app to the app store. I might soon, but am trying to do some initial vetting
through one or two Christmas seasons to work out any issues.
